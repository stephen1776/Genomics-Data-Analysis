The following problems check that you have a grip on a) how to look up and assess the experimental method underlying an experimental data package, b) how to answer a basic question about the human reference genomic sequence.

### Package annotation check

Which of the following biocViews terms is not employed to annotate the Hiiragi2013 experimental data package?

    qPCRdata
    MicroarrayData
    RNASeqData
    ReproducibleResearch 
    
RNASeq Data
See http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/Hiiragi2013.html

###  Reference chromosome lengths

In human genome reference build hg19, what is the length of chromosome 16?
```{r,message=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
length(Hsapiens$chr16)
# or nchar(Hsapiens$chr16)
```
